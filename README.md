# Point Cloud Visibility Analysis
**Purpose**: 
- Viewshed analysis of a 3-D point cloud.
- Calculate which points on a point cloud would be visible from a chosen observation point.

**To use**: 
- Add LAS files of the point cloud to the LAS folder.
- Open notebook, customize configuration variables, and run cells in order.
- In the resulting point cloud, visibility is represented by the color of each point.
    - Green = visible
    - Red = not visible
    - Blue = observer

**Output**: 
- Open3D Visualizer window
- "visibility.las"
- "visibility.ply" (optional)
